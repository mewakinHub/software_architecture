SQLite

In this YouTube video Richard Hipp, the creator of SQLite, gives a lecture about the history of SQLite, what it is for, and when to use it. Hipp's frustration that SQLite is often seen as a baby database rather than a serious alternative to other relational databases comes across in this talk.





This podcast interview with Richard Hipp covers similar themes to the video linked above, but with more emphasis on the origin stories of SQLite. This podcast is available online and via other services such as Spotify. A lot of context and emphasis is placed on SQLite's success as a database as part of mobile operating systems including Android. PHP is briefly mentioned. SQLite's origins in creating software for a warship is covered towards the start of the podcast.

There are also lots of useful online materials for understanding PHP PDO for database connections.
